/*
Defend earth against the relentless barrage of cosmic energy balls by bouncing them back into space. Test your reflexes and aim to achieve the highest score possible!

Notes and Credits:
Try Protecting Earth!
Block the ball, and level up!
You need to achieve a Score of 50!
Each Block gives you one point.
After 5 Points the game gets harder!
You have only three lives, So Focus!
Good Luck Adventurer!
